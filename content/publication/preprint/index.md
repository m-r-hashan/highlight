abstract: "Dengue disease encompasses various clinical manifestations 
including dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). 
In this article, we aimed to systematically review and analyze the 
association between different blood groups and severity of dengue. 
We searched nine databases for eligible papers reporting 
prevalence, distribution, and frequency of blood group type 
among dengue patients. Network meta-analysis using *R software* was 
used to analyze the data."
