abstract : "The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely in 
ACFs residents, from asymptomatic to highly serious cases. Preventing 
the introduction of COVID-19 into aged care facilities is key, and 
both residents and staff are a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. 
Rapid diagnosis, identification of primary and secondary cases and 
close contacts plus their isolation and quarantine are of 
paramount importance."
