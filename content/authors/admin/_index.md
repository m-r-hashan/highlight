Mohammad Rashidul Hashan is a physician by training and 
currently working as medical officer with the Ministry of Health and 
Family Welfare, Government of Bangladesh. He has strong interest in clinical 
and public health research. Currently, Hashan is trying to decipher strategies 
to mitigate the burden of vaccine preventable infectious diseases as a PhD 
student with the Central Queensland University, Australia. He is highly interested in research collaboration and open to suggestion and potential ideas. 
HSRM network is his brain child which conducts project based research to 
provide hands-on support for any devoted research enthusiast.
I consider myself as a lifelong learner and believe in equity and equality.
If you do not find me doing any of these above, perhaps I am enjoying 
nature somewhere in this planet.
